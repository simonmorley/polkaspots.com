This is the repository for polkaspots.com including all the css, js and other assorted goodies.

We'll assume you're not stupid enough to rob our IP, which is why we've put it here.

If you're going to borrow something, here's two great ideas:

1. Don't bother, get your own ideas.
2. Ask us if you can borrow something.

Who knows, we'll probably say yes please!
