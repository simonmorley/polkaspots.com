        h2 Realtime Updates

        h2 Crash Alerts
        p Research shows that 67% of Wi-Fi malfunctions are down to a dodgy broadband service, or the router just being unplugged. So if your box gets disconnected Cucumber Tony will text or email you an alert.

        h2 Speed Tests
        p A slow or 'flapping' broadband connection equals slow and unreliable Wi-Fi. Cucumber Tony will run a speed test on your broadband every night. If it's running too slowly, or the connection is dropping in and out, you'll get an email alert.

        p Not everyone knows this, but you're supposed to reboot a Wi-Fi router every few weeks. It's the same as turning your PC on and off - it's gives it a little refresh. Cucumber Tony lets you schedule your Wi-Fi box to reboot itself every month, so it will always be on it's best behaviour.
