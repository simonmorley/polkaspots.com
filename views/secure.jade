        h2 Public &amp; Private Networks
        p You can create multiple networks for different activites. One for private use one for your applications like your tills and sound system and one for guest to access. So you'll always be seperate from your guests.
        p Coming soon... Create upto 10 wireless networks and even create VLANs to keep things even more secure.

        p You'll never be culpable for something a visitor has downloaded because Cucumber Tony logs your download history via a captive portal.
        p We safely and legally store the download history of your Wi-Fi hotspot for you. Should you run into problems, this will help you detect the rude person who's caused problems.

        p Never fear, your data is important to us. We won't give this data to just anyone. It's all about being responsible.
